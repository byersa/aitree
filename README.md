# Aitree - Solution Proof-of-Concept

`aitree` is a "solution" component built on top of the `moqui-ai` platform. It serves as a real-world testbed and demonstration of the AI-driven development workflow in Moqui.

## Purpose for Moqui Developers
- **Blueprint-Driven Development**: The `blueprints/` directory contains high-level specifications (JSON-LD and Markdown) that define entities, screens, and services. These are processed by an AI agent to generate standard Moqui XML and Groovy files in the appropriate directories.
- **Advanced UI Macro Testing**: This component is used to refine and test high-level UI components, such as the `<discussion-tree>` and dynamic `<menu-dropdown>`, within the context of a functioning application stack.
- **Standard Moqui Structure**: Despite being generated by AI, `aitree` adheres to the standard Moqui component structure (entities in `entity/`, screens in `screen/`, etc.), making it fully compatible with existing Moqui deployments.

*Original Note*: This is a development repository produced with the help of Antigravity. It demonstrates how a "blueprints" folder can guide an agent to produce working Moqui code.
