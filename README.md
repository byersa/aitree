This is just a throwaway repository of a "solution" component that I am developing with the help of Antigravity. 
Note that it has the same .agent folder as moqui-ai, but because it is a solution component it has a new folder, "blueprints", 
that has instructions for building out the other folders - which are standard Moqui folders. 

This is not an example of what a typical solution component would look like. I am mainly using it to refine the top level UI screen macros - in this case a <discussion-tree> one. I am posting it mostly to show how the blueprints folder would work with Antigravity to produce working Moqui code.
